Dear Open Source community, we are glad you would like to help out with this project.<br><br>
Here is a list of **TODO** tasks for this project.

***NOTE : This app, mostly works in Linux & UNIX systems.***

- Make conditional imports to import only OS-specific packages
- Improve performance on UNIX systems
- Splice battery percentage output to 3 digits (maybe 4)
- Replace winsound functionality for *NIX/Linux systems
- Decrease amount of threads spawning
- Better Exception catching (try-except blocks; switch blocks instead of if statements)
- Make suggested percentage not read /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/device/power_supply/BAT0/charge_control_end_threshold (if available) (on Linux only)

We are actively working on the app and will be releasing new versions and packages as soon as we can.
